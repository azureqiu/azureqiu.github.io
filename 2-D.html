      1. affective computing
    <br>
    <br>
    After negotiating with different company, he finished his first painting equipment with his technical team. Meanwhile, he decides to use VR since it offers a complete close space which will has no extraneous interference. Mary is his first testor. She is 29 years old, and she is a museum lover and critic. Her job is financial analyst. She loves art although she isn’t good at painting. She arrives Jason’s studio pretty early and has a cup of coffee on the way. After a short talk with Jason, Jason brings her into his work space. He introduces his equipment and different sensor to Mary. He try to be gentle and patient to create a comfortable space for Mary. They wear the VR headset at same time. Mary choose the background music she wants to dive in. She will express her feeling and the story she wants to share Jason. The different sensors on the equipment detect Mary’s emotion alteration. The brush she is using changes with the data, including color and type. She is also able to add any interaction at any place she wants. For example, there is one stroke which she wants to make viewer feel her passion so the viewer will feel her heartbeats when they touch the stroke. Jason will also dive in the music and paint with Mary’s story. They paint at the same time. If Mary gets tired, they can stop whenever they want and take a rest. There is no rush. After one day, they finish the painting. They upload the painting on Jason’s website so that people can access the painting through internet. They are looking forward to getting feedback.
